# ANxxxx - How to use Force Sensitive Resistor with 12-bit ADC

This application note describes how to use the ADC on tinyAVRÂ® 2 Family microcontrollers to measure a Force Sensitive Resistor. The ADC supports sampling in bursts where a configurable number of conversion results are accumulated into a single ADC result (sample accumulation). This feature is used in the example application to accumulate 1024 samples and perform averaging.

In the example application, the ADC result will be sent to an android/iOS app over Bluetooth communication using the RN4870 Click board. 
The ADC result will also be sent to a serial terminal and a 4x4 RGB Click board is used to illuminate different LEDs corresponding to the applied force on the force sensor on the Force Click board.
